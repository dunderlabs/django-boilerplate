# Django boilerplate #

Django boilerplate to start new projects. Based on [7ws logfreak project](https://github.com/7ws/logfreak).

In the age of web application using React and stuff, we still believe that there is good use cases for a "bare metal" Django project. So with that in mind, we created this boilerplate which uses a basic Django structure with some _tweaks_.

What this boilerplate is using?
-------------------------------

- Python +3.6
- Django 3.0.8
- [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) - Helps you write better programs
- [Bower](https://bower.io/) - A package manager for the frontend
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) - Python packaging and dependency management
- [Bootstrap 4.5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/) -  the worldâ€™s most popular framework
- [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) - Framework to manage and run some git commit hooks:
    - [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
    - [Flake8](https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8)
    - isort

What is next?
-------------
- [ ] [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/)
- [ ] Set up Docker for production
- [ ] Finish Heroku setup

How to use - without docker
---------------------------

First you will need to install `Django` so that you have the `django-admin` command available. Activate your virtual env and run `pip install Django==3.0.8`. Now inside the directory where your project will live, run the following command:

```bash
django-admin startproject project_name --template=https://github.com/dunderlabs/django-boilerplate/archive/main.zip
```

When the above command finishes, you should make a new copy of the `example.env` file renaming this new copy with `.env`. Inside this new new you can change the environment variable values as you need.

After that, all the files from this repo will be inside the directory you created previously. Now to fully install all the requirements, you can just run:

```bash
$ make local-install-requirements
```

If you want to update your requirements, this is the command:

```bash
$ make local-update-requirements
```

Now, let's install the frontend dependencies with:

```bash
$ make local-setup-frontend
```

And start the server:

```bash
$ python manage.py runserver
```

Running the tests
------------------

It's as easy as just:

```bash
$ make local-test-all
```

How to use - with docker
------------------------
Firstly make sure you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed on your machine. After that the second step is to `build` the project, where docker will pull the images to be able to execute our commands. So in order to build it you can run:

```bash
make docker-build
```

When it is finished, you will be ready to run the project using the following commmand:

```bash
make docker-up
```

We also created a shortcut in `bin/run` that you can use to run commands. For example, to run `migrate`:

```bash
./bin/run python manage.py migrate
```

If you just run `./bin/run` it will start the development server.
