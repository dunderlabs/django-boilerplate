# Django boilerplate #

Django boilerplate to start new projects. Based on [7ws logfreak project](https://github.com/7ws/logfreak).

In the age of web application using React and stuff, we still believe that there is good use cases for a "bare metal" Django project. So with that in mind, we created this boilerplate which uses a basic Django structure with some _tweaks_.

What this boilerplate is using?
-------------------------------

- Python +3.6
- Django 3.0.8
- [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) - Helps you write better programs
- [Bower](https://bower.io/) - A package manager for the frontend
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) - Python packaging and dependency management
- [Bootstrap 4.5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/) -  the worldâ€™s most popular framework

What is next?
-------------
- [ ] [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/)
- [ ] [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- [ ] Set up Docker for production
- [ ] Finish Heroku setup

How to use - without docker
---------------------------

First you will need to install `Django` so that you have the `django-admin` command available. Activate your virtual env and run `pip install Django==3.0.8`. Now inside the directory where your project will live, run the following command:

```bash
$ django-admin startproject project_name --template=https://github.com/dunderlabs/django-boilerplate/archive/master.zip
```

When the above command finishes, you should make a new copy of the `example.env` file renaming this new copy with `.env`. Inside this new new you can change the environment variable values as you need.

After that, all the files from this repo will be inside the directory you created previously. Now to fully install all the requirements, you can just run:

```bash
$ make install-requirements
```

If you want to update your requirements, this is the command:

```bash
$ make update-requirements
```

Now, let's install the frontend dependencies with:

```bash
$ make setup-frontend
```

And start the server:

```bash
$ python manage.py runserver
```

Running the tests
------------------

It's as easy as just:

```bash
$ make test
```

How to use - with docker
------------------------
Firstly make sure you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed on your machine. To build it run `docker-compose build` and when it is finished, you will be ready to run the project. We also created a shortcut in `bin/run` that you can use to run commands. For example:

- To run `migrate`: `./bin/run python manage.py migrate`

If you just run `./bin/run` it will start the development project server.
